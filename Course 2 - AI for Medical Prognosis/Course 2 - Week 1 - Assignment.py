# ## Overview of the Assignment
# 
# In this assignment, you'll build a risk score model for retinopathy in diabetes patients using logistic regression.
# 
# As we develop the model, we will learn about the following topics:
# 
# - Data preprocessing
#   - Log transformations
#   - Standardization
# - Basic Risk Models
#   - Logistic Regression
#   - C-index
#   - Interactions Terms
#   
# ### Diabetic Retinopathy
# Retinopathy is an eye condition that causes changes to the blood vessels in the part of the eye called the retina.
# This often leads to vision changes or blindness.
# Diabetic patients are known to be at high risk for retinopathy. 
#     
# ### Logistic Regression    
# Logistic regression is an appropriate analysis to use for predicting the probability of a binary outcome. In our case, this would be the probability of having or not having diabetic retinopathy.
# Logistic Regression is one of the most commonly used algorithms for binary classification. It is used to find the best fitting model to describe the relationship between a set of features (also referred to as input, independent, predictor, or explanatory variables) and a binary outcome label (also referred to as an output, dependent, or response variable). Logistic regression has the property that the output prediction is always in the range $[0,1]$. Sometimes this output is used to represent a probability from 0%-100%, but for straight binary classification, the output is converted to either $0$ or $1$ depending on whether it is below or above a certain threshold, usually $0.5$.
# 
# It may be  confusing that the term regression appears in the name even though logistic regression is actually a classification algorithm, but that's just a name it was given for historical reasons.

# ## 1.  Import Packages
# 
# We'll first import all the packages that we need for this assignment. 
# 
# - `numpy` is the fundamental package for scientific computing in python.
# - `pandas` is what we'll use to manipulate our data.
# - `matplotlib` is a plotting library.

# In[1]:


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# <a name='2'></a>
# ## 2. Load Data
# 
# First we will load in the dataset that we will use for training and testing our model.
# 
# - Run the next cell to load the data that is stored in csv files.
# - There is a function `load_data` which randomly generates data, but for consistency, please use the data from the csv files.

# In[2]:


from utils import load_data

# This function creates randomly generated data
# X, y = load_data(6000)

# For stability, load data from files that were generated using the load_data
X = pd.read_csv('X_data.csv',index_col=0)
y_df = pd.read_csv('y_data.csv',index_col=0)
y = y_df['y']


# `X` and `y` are Pandas DataFrames that hold the data for 6,000 diabetic patients. 

# <a name='3'></a>
# ##  3. Explore the Dataset
# 
# The features (`X`) include the following fields:
# * Age: (years)
# * Systolic_BP: Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)
# * Diastolic_BP: Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
# * Cholesterol: (mg/DL)
#     
# We can use the `head()` method to display the first few records of each.    

# In[3]:


X.head()


# The target (`y`) is an indicator of whether or not the patient developed retinopathy.
# 
# * y = 1 : patient has retinopathy.
# * y = 0 : patient does not have retinopathy.

# In[4]:


y.head()


# Before we build a model, let's take a closer look at the distribution of our training data. To do this, we will split the data into train and test sets using a 75/25 split.
# 
# For this, we can use the built in function provided by sklearn library.  See the documentation for [sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html). 

# In[5]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


# In[6]:


X_train_raw, X_test_raw, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.75, random_state=0)


# Plot the histograms of each column of `X_train` below: 

# In[7]:


for col in X.columns:
    X_train_raw.loc[:, col].hist()
    plt.title(col)
    plt.show()


# As we can see, the distributions have a generally bell shaped distribution, but with slight rightward skew.
# 
# Many statistical models assume that the data is normally distributed, forming a symmetric Gaussian bell shape (with no skew) more like the example below.

# In[8]:


from scipy.stats import norm
data = np.random.normal(50,12, 5000)
fitting_params = norm.fit(data)
norm_dist_fitted = norm(*fitting_params)
t = np.linspace(0,100, 100)
plt.hist(data, bins=60, density=True)
plt.plot(t, norm_dist_fitted.pdf(t))
plt.title('Example of Normally Distributed Data')
plt.show()


# We can transform our data to be closer to a normal distribution by removing the skew. One way to remove the skew is by applying the log function to the data.
# 
# Let's plot the log of the feature variables to see that it produces the desired effect.

# In[9]:


for col in X_train_raw.columns:
    np.log(X_train_raw.loc[:, col]).hist()
    plt.title(col)
    plt.show()


# We can see that the data is more symmetric after taking the log.

# <a name='4'></a>
# ## 4. Mean-Normalize the Data
# 
# Let's now transform our data so that the distributions are closer to standard normal distributions.
# 
# First we will remove some of the skew from the distribution by using the log transformation.
# Then we will "standardize" the distribution so that it has a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1. Recall that a standard normal distribution has mean of zero and standard deviation of 1. 
# 

# <a name='Ex-1'></a>
# ### Exercise 1
# * Write a function that first removes some of the skew in the data, and then standardizes the distribution so that for each data point $x$,
# $$\overline{x} = \frac{x - mean(x)}{std(x)}$$
# * Keep in mind that we want to pretend that the test data is "unseen" data. 
#     * This implies that it is unavailable to us for the purpose of preparing our data, and so we do not want to consider it when evaluating the mean and standard deviation that we use in the above equation. Instead we want to calculate these values using the training data alone, but then use them for standardizing both the training and the test data.
#     * For a further discussion on the topic, see this article ["Why do we need to re-use training parameters to transform test data"](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/scale-training-test.html). 

# #### Note
# - For the sample standard deviation, please calculate the unbiased estimator:
# $$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_{i} - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$
# - In other words, if you numpy, set the degrees of freedom `ddof` to 1.
# - For pandas, the default `ddof` is already set to 1.

#     <ul>
#         <li> When working with Pandas DataFrames, you can use the aggregation functions <code>mean</code> and <code>std</code> functions. Note that in order to apply an aggregation function separately for each row or each column, you'll set the axis parameter to either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. One produces the aggregation along columns and the other along rows, but it is easy to get them confused. So experiment with each option below to see which one you should use to get an average for each column in the dataframe.
# <code>
# avg = df.mean(axis=0)
# avg = df.mean(axis=1) 
# </code>

# <a name='6'></a>
# ## 6. Evaluate the Model Using the C-index
# 
# Now that we have a model, we need to evaluate it. We'll do this using the c-index. 
# * The c-index measures the discriminatory power of a risk score. 
# * Intuitively, a higher c-index indicates that the model's prediction is in agreement with the actual outcomes of a pair of patients.
# * The formula for the c-index is
# 
# $$ \mbox{cindex} = \frac{\mbox{concordant} + 0.5 \times \mbox{ties}}{\mbox{permissible}} $$
# 
# * A permissible pair is a pair of patients who have different outcomes.
# * A concordant pair is a permissible pair in which the patient with the higher risk score also has the worse outcome.
# * A tie is a permissible pair where the patients have the same risk score.
# 

# <a name='Ex-3'></a>
# ### Exercise 3
# 
# * Implement the `cindex` function to compute c-index.
# * `y_true` is the array of actual patient outcomes, 0 if the patient does not eventually get the disease, and 1 if the patient eventually gets the disease.
# * `scores` is the risk score of each patient.  These provide relative measures of risk, so they can be any real numbers. By convention, they are always non-negative.
# * Here is an example of input data and how to interpret it:
# ```Python
# y_true = [0,1]
# scores = [0.45, 1.25]
# ```
#     * There are two patients. Index 0 of each array is associated with patient 0.  Index 1 is associated with patient 1.
#     * Patient 0 does not have the disease in the future (`y_true` is 0), and based on past information, has a risk score of 0.45.
#     * Patient 1 has the disease at some point in the future (`y_true` is 1), and based on past information, has a risk score of 1.25.

# ## 7. Evaluate the Model on the Test Set
# 
# Now, you can evaluate your trained model on the test set.  
# 
# To get the predicted probabilities, we use the `predict_proba` method. This method will return the result from the model *before* it is converted to a binary 0 or 1. For each input case, it returns an array of two values which represent the probabilities for both the negative case (patient does not get the disease) and positive case (patient the gets the disease).

# ### Question: 
# > __Which three variables have the largest impact on the model's predictions?__

# <a name='8'></a>
# ## 8. Improve the Model
# 
# You can try to improve your model by including interaction terms. 
# * An interaction term is the product of two variables. 
#     * For example, if we have data 
#     $$ x = [x_1, x_2]$$
#     * We could add the product so that:
#     $$ \hat{x} = [x_1, x_2, x_1*x_2]$$

# Once you have correctly implemented `add_interactions`, use it to make transformed version of `X_train` and `X_test`.

# In[47]:


X_train_int = add_interactions(X_train)
X_test_int = add_interactions(X_test)


# <a name='9'></a>
# ## 9. Evaluate the Improved Model
# 
# Now we can train the new and improved version of the model.

# In[48]:


model_X_int = lr_model(X_train_int, y_train)


# Let's evaluate our new model on the test set.

# In[49]:


scores_X = model_X.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
c_index_X_int_test = cindex(y_test.values, scores_X)

scores_X_int = model_X_int.predict_proba(X_test_int)[:, 1]
c_index_X_int_test = cindex(y_test.values, scores_X_int)

print(f"c-index on test set without interactions is {c_index_X_test:.4f}")
print(f"c-index on test set with interactions is {c_index_X_int_test:.4f}")


# You should see that the model with interaction terms performs a bit better than the model without interactions.
# 
# Now let's take another look at the model coefficients to try and see which variables made a difference. Plot the coefficients and report which features seem to be the most important.

# In[50]:


int_coeffs = pd.DataFrame(data = model_X_int.coef_, columns = X_train_int.columns)
int_coeffs.T.plot.bar();


# ### Questions:
# > __Which variables are most important to the model?__<br>
# > __Have the relevant variables changed?__<br>
# > __What does it mean when the coefficients are positive or negative?__<br>
# 
# You may notice that Age, Systolic_BP, and Cholesterol have a positive coefficient. This means that a higher value in these three features leads to a higher prediction probability for the disease. You also may notice that the interaction of Age x Cholesterol has a negative coefficient. This means that a higher value for the Age x Cholesterol product reduces the prediction probability for the disease.
# 
# To understand the effect of interaction terms, let's compare the output of the model we've trained on sample cases with and without the interaction. Run the cell below to choose an index and look at the features corresponding to that case in the training set. 

# In[51]:


index = index = 3432
case = X_train_int.iloc[index, :]
print(case)


# We can see that they have above average Age and Cholesterol. We can now see what our original model would have output by zero-ing out the value for Cholesterol and Age.

# In[52]:


new_case = case.copy(deep=True)
new_case.loc["Age_x_Cholesterol"] = 0
new_case


# In[53]:


print(f"Output with interaction: \t{model_X_int.predict_proba([case.values])[:, 1][0]:.4f}")
print(f"Output without interaction: \t{model_X_int.predict_proba([new_case.values])[:, 1][0]:.4f}")


# #### Expected output
# ```CPP
# Output with interaction: 0.9448
# Output without interaction: 0.9965
# ```

# We see that the model is less confident in its prediction with the interaction term than without (the prediction value is lower when including the interaction term). With the interaction term, the model has adjusted for the fact that the effect of high cholesterol becomes less important for older patients compared to younger patients.

# # Congratulations! 
# 
# You have finished the first assignment of Course 2.
